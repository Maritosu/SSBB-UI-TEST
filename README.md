i love smash bros brawl ui so much that i decided to make a little construct 3 project on it

Notes:
This project is WIP meaning alot of what just works - bethesda
This thing isnt mobile comaptible yet due to the fact it only uses the mouse plugin but support for mobile is planned
This project ui isnt very accurate to the original game

Features:
Simple ui that looks simple
Greatly compressed audio images code to reduce the Project size
MARIO

now thats all for it now enjoy

you can also download an Windows Linux build to use it offline btw!
